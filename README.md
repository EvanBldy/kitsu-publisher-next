# Kitsu Publisher, send your files right from your DCC

Kitsu is a web application to share the progress of your productions and
validate your deliveries. It improves the communication between all stakeholders.
Which leads to better pictures, shipped faster.

The Kitsu Publisher is a desktop application that connects DCC Tools to Kitsu.
Through it, your artists can see their todo list, comment tasks and send previews to Kitsu
directly from their tools.
